# What

Minigma will be a small replica of a 3-wheel enigma. While my idea is to build
is as accurate as possible, I'm very pragmatic and not planning to become
obsessed by details.

# Original

# Parts

## Keyboard (input)

 - Using mini keys like 'Taktschalter Push Button DIP P4'
 - combining them like here: http://blog.komar.be/how-to-make-a-keyboard-the-matrix/

## Lamps (output)

 - Could potentially make the minigma significant easier by using 16-segment display is stead of the normal 26 lamps (for each letter 1)
 - Cool: Nixie

## letter dails

 - oled display?
 - 3 16-segment displays + 6 push buttons?
 - Rotary Switch Sections Wafers NOS 1P26T 1 Pole 26 positions Lot of 3 ?
 - 

## crypto engine

 - ESP32 / ESP 8266 with IO/extenders over i2c
 - in LUA, nodeMCU

## IO requirements

 - 26 letters input (matrix, so probably 6+6 ? )
 - 26 letter outputs (again, 6 +6 )
 - 2 * 3 button for 3 wheels up/down
